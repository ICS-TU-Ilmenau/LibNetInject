Instructions for installing LibNetInject on your system
=============================================================

 The source code of LibNetInject was built for Windows (XP/2003/Vista/7), 
 Linux, OS X (Snow Leopard) and FreeBSD. Please use always the latest release
 version from https://github.com/ThomasVolkert/LibNetInject to build 
 LibNetInject. 

Install LibNetInject:
===========================

 At least gcc version 4.4 is needed to build LibNetInject.
 Additionally, GNU Make and CMake is needed during build process.

 Create and install LibNetInject via:

    > "cd LibNetInjectBuild"
    > "make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar"

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries depending on your 
    current system configuration. All binary files are build without debug 
    symbols and the output is stripped. After these steps you can start 
    LibNetInjectTests via the command line "./bin/tests".
    Additionally, all created files will be installed to "/foo/bar/".
    Libraries will be copied to "/foo/bar/lib" and binaries to "/foo/bar/bin".
    The default directory (without INSTALL_PREFIX parameter) is "/usr/local".


System dependencies:
====================

 To build LibNetInject several libraries from other projects are needed. 
 The following gives an overview.

    - Library "LibNetInject": libnet, libpcap


Removing old build data and restoring default data:
===================================================

 You can reset the LibNetInject directories and restore defaults via:

    > "cd LibNetInjectBuild"
    > "make distclean"

    After these commands all data from the last build run is deleted. You can 
    use "make clean" if you want to remove only the temporary build files and 
    keep the resulting CMake generated Makefile and binaries form the last 
    build run on the disc.



Install libraries and data files to a different directory:
==========================================================

 It is possible to install all built libraries to an explicitly given directory.
 This can be triggered via:
 
     >"make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar INSTALL_LIBDIR=/foo/bar/lib64 INSTALL_DATADIR=/foo/bar/share"
     
     This will install all libraries to the directory "/foo/bar/lib64" instead of "/foo/bar/lib". 
     Additionally, this will install all data files, e.g. png files, to "/foo/bar/share". 



Additional information to build LibNetInject on OS X systems:
===================================================================

 Current OS X releases of LibNetInject are built with cmake 2.8.* for OS X and Apple's 
 Xcode 4.5.*, which includes both gcc and binutils in current versions.


DEVELOPER: build LibNetInject with debug symbols:
=======================================================

 Create a debug build via:

    > "cd LibNetInjectBuild"
    > "make" (alternatively "make debug")

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries based on the pre-compiled 
    files from the LibNetInject-Release package. All binary files are built with debug 
    symbols and the output isn't stripped. If you need the LibNetInject-Release package 
    see https://github.com/ThomasVolkert/LibNetInject-Release.


DEVELOPER: debug the build process:
===================================

 In general, GNU Make supports the parameter "VERBOSE=1". The LibNetInject build system 
 supports this parameter, too.
  
 Get verbose output during build process via:

    > "cd LibNetInjectBuild"
    > "make VERBOSE=1"

 This shows several verbose outputs and often gives a good hint why header files
 weren't found or why linking failed.

 Get even more verbose output during build process via:

    > "cd LibNetInjectBuild"
    > "make VERBOSE=2"
